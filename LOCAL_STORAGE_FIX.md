# Local Storage Persistence Fix

## Problem
Your Electron app was clearing local storage when closing and reopening due to several configuration issues:

1. **Cache clearing on startup**: `session.defaultSession.clearCache()` was clearing all session data
2. **Aggressive cache disabling**: Multiple command line switches were disabling application caches
3. **Missing persistence configuration**: No explicit configuration for persistent storage

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Cache Clearing
- Removed `session.defaultSession.clearCache()` from app startup
- This was the main culprit causing data loss

### 2. Optimized Cache Configuration
- Removed overly aggressive cache-disabling switches:
  - `--disable-application-cache`
  - `--disable-offline-load-stale-cache`
  - `--disable-disk-cache`
  - `--disable-media-cache`
  - `--disable-http-cache`
  - `--disable-web-security`
  - `--disable-features=VizDisplayCompositor`

### 3. Added Persistence Features
- Added `--enable-features=PersistentStorage`
- Added `--enable-features=LocalStorage`
- Added `--enable-features=Cookies`

### 4. Enhanced BrowserWindow Configuration
- Added `persistentStorage: true` to main window
- Added `partition: 'persist:main'` for persistent session data
- Applied same configuration to recording overlay window

## How to Test

### 1. Run the App
Start your Electron app in development mode

### 2. Use Test Buttons
You'll see two test buttons in the top-right corner (only in development mode):
- **Blue button**: "Test LocalStorage" - Sets test data
- **Red button**: "Clear Test Data" - Cleans up test data

### 3. Test Persistence
1. Click "Test LocalStorage" button
2. Note the timestamp value shown in the alert
3. Close the app completely
4. Reopen the app
5. Check the browser console for persistence confirmation
6. You should see: "✅ Found existing test value in localStorage: [timestamp]"

### 4. Verify in Console
Open browser console (F12) and look for:
- "Set persistent test value: [timestamp]"
- "✅ Found existing test value in localStorage: [timestamp]"
- "✅ This confirms localStorage persistence is working!"

## What to Expect

- **localStorage**: Values should persist between app restarts
- **sessionStorage**: Values should NOT persist (this is normal behavior)
- **authToken**: Should now persist properly
- **Other app data**: Should persist as expected

## Clean Up

After testing, click the "Clear Test Data" button to remove test values.

## Files Modified

1. `src/main/index.js` - Main process configuration
2. `src/renderer/src/App.jsx` - Added test functions and buttons

## Why This Happened

The original configuration was designed to fix cache-related permission errors but was too aggressive, disabling essential persistence features. The fix maintains the necessary cache optimizations while ensuring data persistence works correctly.

## If Issues Persist

1. Check that you're not running in incognito/private mode
2. Verify the app has proper permissions to write to user data directory
3. Check for any antivirus software blocking file access
4. Ensure you're not clearing browser data manually
